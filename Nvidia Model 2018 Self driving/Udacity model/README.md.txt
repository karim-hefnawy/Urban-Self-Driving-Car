<h1>Udacity simulator testing</h1>


<p> Here is a simple demo video after Training the model and seeing it's result in the video as real time testing </p>
<h3>if you want to go through the whole process you should make the following :</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Run the simulator and collect some data by manually driving the car for 30 minutes </li>
  <li>After collecting several pictures u will have csv extension file , open it with excel and insert index column in beginning</li>
  <li>Run First.py , Second.py and third.py codes beside the driving_log.csv file which you got after collecting data</li>
  <li>you will get file called "comdataandpics.csv file</li>
  <li>Open Model.py and specify hyper parameters like epochs number, sample per epoch and batch size in arguments options</li>
  <li>You also need to specify where precisly you csv file exist on your file system , it's not relative address in arguments options</li>
  <li>Now Run Model.py and it will take some time depends on how strong is your machine </li>
  <li>you will get every epoch output .h5 file , try the best of them to get best performance ,you will get graphs of your training at the end also.</li>
</ol>
